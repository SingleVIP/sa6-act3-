Problem 4: Intersection of Two Lists
Objective: Write a Python program that finds the intersection of two lists using a 
lambda function and the filter() function. The program should return a list of 
elements that are present in both lists.
Hint: You may want to use the filter() function to keep only the elements in one 
list that are also contained in the other list.
